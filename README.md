# MNIST Fashion Classification using TensorFlow #

**About this project:**


A case study about classification of fashion dataset using TensorFlow. This project was made in 2019 and I want to thank my amazing team: M.Hakim Amransyah & Rendi Hermawan for making this project possible. There are 2 models built for this project.


_PS: The code in this repository is part of the work I did when I was attending workshop/training._
